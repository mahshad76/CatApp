# âœ¨ Features
This application consists of multiple activities and fragments following the MVC architecture. It also implements four important and commonly used XML layouts, listed below:

- RecyclerView: Efficiently displays a list of cats and their descriptions through view recycling.

- Navigation Drawer (DrawerLayout): Implements a side-panel navigation menu that slides in from the left edge.

- ViewPager: Opens when the Info option from the navigation drawer is selected, allowing horizontal swiping between multiple screens or fragments.

- Bottom Navigation (BottomNavigationView): Appears when a card in the RecyclerView is selected, enabling navigation between sections within the new activity.
